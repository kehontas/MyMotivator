## MyMotivator
MyMotivator is an app designed with the "Minimum of 6", a goal achieving method
developed by Kehontas Rowe.  This app allows the user to create
a goal and 6 steps to complete that goal. The user will receive sms reminders
to complete the steps and can respond to the sms reminders in order to
check off the steps. This allows the user interact with their goal and steps via the
the web app as well as a mobile platform.
